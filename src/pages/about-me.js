          Hi there! My name is Zac Braddy, and I am a{' '}
          <Highlight>Lead Software Engineer</Highlight> with about eight years
          of experience. I'm super jazzed by great tech and awesome
          architecture. In case you're wondering how much I like doing the
          things I do with computers, well to put it simply;{' '}
          <Highlight>I'm super obsessed by tech</Highlight>. Put this way;
          sometimes, I feel like I might be a mutant code monkey sent back from
          the future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But it's not just a good tech stack that excites me, when it comes
          down to it, what really excites me is working with great teams to
          deliver quality software, on time, to people who can use it to shape
          our futureâ€”and <Highlight>having fun while doing it!</Highlight>

          This varied experience has seen me working with a lot of different
          types of tech and engineering software in many different shapes and
          sizes. It's also allowed me to practice{' '}
          <Highlight>pragmatically delivering software</Highlight>, and this has
          unlocked my ability to produce software at a high quality and in a
          timely fashion.

      <AbilityDescription title="Software Architecture" icon={faPencilRuler}>
        <p>
          I've spent a fair amount of time collecting practices and techniques
          for building{' '}
          <Highlight> highly scalable, maintainable and extensible</Highlight>{' '}
          software architecture that adheres to SOLID and DDD principles as well
          as others. I've also learned from experience that architecture is more
          than just stringing together boxes on a whiteboard in the right order.

          Through good project management and providing the right level of

              Having worked with Zac on some informal projects, I can say that
              he's be an asset to any team if he brings as much enthusiasm and
              drive to those projects as he does to your team. He is constantly
              keeping me up to date with the latest developments in both the
              technologies he uses, and the systems he uses to support them. On
              top of that, Zac is one of the best positive motivators I have
              ever met.
