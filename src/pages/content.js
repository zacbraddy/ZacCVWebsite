            In this podcast, myself and two other co-hosts spend an hour a month
            riffing on topics that are common to all developers and give our
            opinions on them and strategies for dealing with them.

            Although it was some time ago in the JS space, I've also published a
            course through Manning on React

            Although I don't have a lot of recorded conference talks I do quite
            enjoy sharing my ideas about development at local developer
            conferences. Here is a talk that I did in 2019.

            Although writing long-form blog posts can be time-consuming to both
            write and read; sometimes, they are the best way to convey complex
            ideas. I like to share my thoughts on Medium although I have been
            thinking recently of moving to dev.to

            I've featured as a guest on a number of other people's podcasts as
            well talking about my thoughts and experience in the software
            development field

            I wouldn't call myself a "youtuber" but I've dabbled and had some
            fun making some videos about Vim disguised as a computer generated
            cat!

            Quite some time ago, I spent time building a community around React
            when it was still new and shiny. "The Reactionary" included a blog,
            youtube channel and other pieces of community building content.
            Unfortunately, all that's left of those days is the youtube channel.
