        At Odondo, I took on the challenge of fixing their Django monolith and
        boy, did I deliver! With the COO by my side, I mapped out a plan for
        success and dove headfirst into the code. Despite the headaches and
        obstacles, I kept my cool and kept cranking out top-notch software.
      </p>
      <p>
        To revamp their system, I built an anti-corruption layer around the old
        code and slowly but surely transitioned to a shiny new system. The
        result? Odondo had a reliable Fast API backend system utilizing AWS
        CloudWatch, Lambdas, and SQS. On the frontend, I created three React SPA
        applications tailored to each customer type that Odondo serviced. And to
        make sure everything ran like a well-oiled machine, I implemented
        rock-solid Github actions CI/CD pipelines and terraform modules.

        At LMS, I became the hero of a front-end project that was in dire need
        of rescuing. With a looming deadline and a junior developer who was in
        over their head, I stepped in to save the day without bruising any egos.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we couldn't implement every improvement we wanted, we were able to
        get the project back on track and deliver on time. By the time I left
        LMS, the junior developer had grown more confident and competent, and
        the front-end solution was in great shape. It was scalable,
        maintainable, and ready to handle whatever the business threw at it.

        When I joined Koodoo, I was one of the first four developers to join the
        team, and was excited to take on the role of Lead Software Engineer.
        Together with the team, we developed a cutting-edge microservices system
        that leveraged Koodoo's expertise in the mortgage market - they had
        recently pivoted from other mortgage-related ventures after I joined
        their former company, Dynamo.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Koodoo, I spent my days crafting and refining the software
        architecture, while also taking the lead on its implementation.
        Alongside my team, we constantly worked to level up our skills and
        knowledge, chipping away at the software to make it better every day.
        The result was a system that was as sharp as a three-piece suit when it
        hit the board rooms of our potential customers. We moved fast and got
        things done, all while taking care to ensure we were building a secure
        future for ourselves.

        During my time at RightIndem as Principal Developer, I was responsible
        for leading a team of five developers on a greenfield project alongside
        the two other teams in the company. The goal was to build an application
        using cutting-edge technology that was extensible, maintainable, and
        delivered on time. To achieve this, we chose to build an event-driven
        CQRS-based system, which allowed for a sleek and performant user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to making key decisions around the architecture and ensuring
        timely delivery, I also managed several aspects of the project,
        including hiring new staff, mentoring and developing current staff, and
        maintaining team morale and productivity. Overall, it was a challenging
        yet fulfilling experience, and I'm proud of the results we achieved as a
        team.
