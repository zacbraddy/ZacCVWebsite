          This varied experience has seen me working with a lot of different
          types of tech and engineering software in many different shapes and
          sizes. It's also allowed me to practice{' '}
          <Highlight>pragmatically delivering software</Highlight>, and this has
          unlocked my ability to produce software at a high quality and in a
          timely fashion.

        <p>
          I've spent a fair amount of time collecting practices and techniques
          for building{' '}
          <Highlight> highly scalable, maintainable and extensible</Highlight>{' '}
          software architecture that adheres to SOLID and DDD principles as well
          as others. I've also learned from experience that architecture is more
          than just stringing together boxes on a whiteboard in the right order.

          Delivering software projects to the right level of quality and on-time
          is vital for any business but in startups like ones I've been{' '}
          <Highlight>helping to succeed</Highlight> this is especially true.
          Through good project management and providing the right level of
          support and encouragement to the teams I've worked with, I've been
          able to help lead them towards the{' '}

          individual team members.
