# Story 2.4: Build the two-pane reading room and sectioned navigation

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a technical evaluator,
I want a calm two-pane reading room with a sectioned, scannable navigation of the docs,
so that I can see the shape of the decision set at a glance and move between docs easily, on desktop or mobile (UJ-2).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Two-pane reading room at `lg+` (UX-DR2, AR-7/D4).** `src/app/backroom/layout.tsx` is upgraded from the current single centred column to a **near-full-bleed two-pane shell inside a 48px gradient frame on all sides**: a **320px** left nav panel (`bg-primary-200`) that **scrolls independently**, and a flexible content pane (`bg-primary-400`) with **56px** horizontal padding whose reading column is capped at **64ch**, left-aligned (the 64ch cap is already enforced by the existing `doc-content.module.css` — do **not** add a second cap in the layout). Depth is **flat/tonal**: the one-step `bg-primary-200`↔`bg-primary-400` difference plus at most a **single soft drop-shadow** to lift the shell off the gradient — no heavy borders, no glows. No hardcoded colours; the theme toggle works across both panes (UX-DR19). Working radius `rounded.md` (8px).

2. **Sectioned nav built from the Velite typed `docs` array (FR-8, AR-14, UX-DR4/5/6/7/15).** A `backroom-nav` **organism** (Server Component) imports `docs` from `@velite`, groups rows under section labels in the fixed order **OVERVIEW → DECISIONS → PRAGMATISM & PROCESS**, and **omits any empty section**. Within DECISIONS, rows sort by `adr` ascending; within other sections by `order` ascending; **`order`/`adr` collisions fall back to a stable secondary sort by `slug` (filename)**. Each row is a `backroom-nav-row` **molecule**: the **whole row is one `<Link>`** to its doc route (Overview → `/backroom`; every other doc → `/backroom/<slug>`), rendering a **40px tile + nav-row title + one `text-dim` teaser line**, with a hover wash, a `selected` state (cyan-tint background + left cyan accent bar + inverted tile fill) and **`aria-current="page"`** on the row whose route matches the current path. Tiles are atoms: `number-tile` (cyan, the zero-padded `adr` number — e.g. `04`), `glyph-tile` (gold ◆ for _Pragmatism & process_, gold ★ for _Overview_); `section-label` is a tracked dim-caps atom. A **new `docs/public/*.md` slots into its section on the next build with no manual nav edit** (UJ-3) — the nav is a pure function of `docs`.

3. **Responsive collapse below `lg` (UX-DR3) + accessibility floor (UX-DR18, NFR-5).** Below `lg` the layout is a **single full-width column**, the desktop nav panel is hidden, and the **entire nav (back link + section labels + rows) moves into a hamburger drawer** mirroring the front-of-house vaul mobile pattern; the content runs full-width. The Backroom uses **semantic HTML** — the nav is a **labelled landmark**, content is a `<main>`, headings stay in order (from `doc-content`), lists/`<a>` are real elements — **tab order matches reading order**, **focus is visible**, the active row carries `aria-current="page"`, and the drawer is **keyboard-operable** (Esc-close, focus trap — inherited from vaul). The `xs: 410px` custom breakpoint applies as elsewhere.

4. **Conditional route-transition gate (AR-8 / G4) + verification (AR-15).** The new Backroom layout is authored taking the **path of least resistance** — no special work to add _or_ remove a route transition. The expected (and recommended) outcome is **no inter-doc transition** (the layout simply does not import `ContentTransition`/`FrozenRouter`, exactly as the current minimal layout already omits them). **If** the least-resistance result somehow leaves the Backroom **with** transitions, surface it for Zac (approve-with-transitions or require removal); **if none**, ship as-is — do **not** re-introduce a transition without that review. `npm run build` is green with **every Backroom route static** (`/backroom`, `/backroom/framework-decision`, `/backroom/deferring-the-polish`, `/backroom/building-with-ai-and-bmad` — no `.func`), the **front-of-house shows zero regression** (NFR-2 — this story touches **no** `(site)`/`SiteShell` files under the recommended approach), `npm run lint` is clean, and no test runs are fabricated.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1 — Build the tile + label atoms (AC: #2)**
  - [ ] `src/components/atoms/section-label.tsx` — presentational; renders tracked dim caps. Type scale UX-DR16: 10.5px / 700 / `letter-spacing 0.14em`, uppercase, `text-dim` at ~0.7 opacity. Tailwind: `text-[10.5px] font-bold tracking-[0.14em] uppercase text-dim opacity-70` (or a small CSS module — your call). Takes `children`.
  - [ ] `src/components/atoms/number-tile.tsx` — 40px square (`w-10 h-10`), 8px radius (`rounded-md`), grid-centred, `bg-primary-400` fg `text-secondary`, `1px` border `rgba(4,180,224,0.4)`, font 15px/700. Renders the **zero-padded-to-2-digits** `adr` (`String(adr).padStart(2, '0')` → `04`, `09`, `18`, `25` — matches the mock). Prop `{ adr: number; selected: boolean }`. **Selected** → solid cyan fill (`bg-secondary`) with `bg-primary-400` text colour (the mock's `background: var(--secondary); color: var(--bg-primary-400)`), border cyan.
  - [ ] `src/components/atoms/glyph-tile.tsx` — same box as `number-tile` but **gold**: fg `text-tertiary`, border `1px rgba(224,180,4,0.45)`, glyph 18px. Prop `{ glyph: string; selected: boolean }` (callers pass `★` U+2605 for Overview, `◆` U+2666 for Pragmatism & process). **Selected** → solid **gold** fill (`bg-tertiary`) with `bg-primary-400` text (see Dev Notes "Flagged decision 2 — selected glyph-tile fill"; recommended gold, flagged for Zac).
  - [ ] Use the existing `@utility` theme tokens for solid colours (`bg-secondary`, `text-secondary`, `bg-tertiary`, `text-tertiary`, `bg-primary-400`) so they flip with the theme; use Tailwind **arbitrary-value** classes only for the DESIGN-specified low-alpha **border rgba** (`border-[rgba(4,180,224,0.4)]` / `border-[rgba(224,180,4,0.45)]`). These tiny atoms have **no hooks** — keep them as plain presentational components (they will be bundled client-side because the row that renders them is a client component; that is fine, they are trivial).
- [ ] **Task 2 — Build the `backroom-nav-row` molecule (client leaf) (AC: #2, #3)**
  - [ ] `src/components/molecules/backroom-nav-row.tsx` — `'use client'` (needs `usePathname`, mirroring `atoms/nav-link.tsx`). Props `{ href: string; title: string; teaser: string; section: Doc['section']; adr?: number }`.
  - [ ] Compute `isCurrent = usePathname() === href` (exact match — these are leaf routes; Overview's `href` is `/backroom`, doc rows are `/backroom/<slug>`; no `startsWith`).
  - [ ] Whole row is one `<Link href={href}>`. Grid `40px 1fr`, 12px gap, `p-[10px_12px]`, `rounded-md`, `border-l-[3px] border-transparent`. **Hover:** `hover:bg-[rgba(250,250,250,0.06)]`. **Selected (`isCurrent`):** `bg-[rgba(4,180,224,0.14)]` + `border-l-secondary` (left cyan accent bar) + pass `selected` to the tile. Set `aria-current={isCurrent ? 'page' : undefined}` on the `<Link>`.
  - [ ] Tile choice: `section === 'Decisions'` (has `adr`) → `<NumberTile adr={adr} selected={isCurrent} />`; `section === 'Overview'` → `<GlyphTile glyph="★" selected={isCurrent} />`; `section === 'Pragmatism & process'` → `<GlyphTile glyph="◆" selected={isCurrent} />`.
  - [ ] Text block: `title` (`text-[14px] font-medium leading-[1.25] text-primary`) over `teaser` (`text-[12px] leading-[1.3] text-dim mt-[3px]`).
  - [ ] **Close the mobile drawer on navigation:** call `useMenuOpen().setMenuOpen(false)` in the row's `onClick`. This is a no-op on desktop (drawer already closed) and closes the drawer on mobile — one shared row component serves both surfaces (mirrors how `NavLinks` takes an `onClick`). See Dev Notes "Mobile drawer reuse".
- [ ] **Task 3 — Build the `backroom-nav` organism (server, data-driven) (AC: #2)**
  - [ ] `src/components/organisms/backroom-nav.tsx` — **Server Component** (no `'use client'`). Imports `import { docs, type Doc } from '@velite'`.
  - [ ] Group `docs` by `section` into the fixed order `['Overview', 'Decisions', 'Pragmatism & process']`; **skip any section with zero docs**. Sort within a section: Decisions by `adr` asc then `slug`; others by `order` asc then `slug`. (Helper: `[...sectionDocs].sort((a, b) => (a.adr ?? a.order) - (b.adr ?? b.order) || a.slug.localeCompare(b.slug))` — or split the two cases explicitly.)
  - [ ] For each section, render a `<SectionLabel>` then the rows. Map each doc to a `<BackroomNavRow href={doc.section === 'Overview' ? '/backroom' : `/backroom/${doc.slug}`} title={doc.title} teaser={doc.teaser} section={doc.section} adr={doc.adr} />`.
  - [ ] **Do NOT pass `doc.content`** into the row (or any client component). `backroom-nav` reads only `{ section, order, adr, slug, title, teaser }`. See Dev Notes "RSC payload gotcha (don't ship `doc.content` to the client)".
  - [ ] `backroom-nav` renders the **rows + labels only** (no `<nav>` wrapper) — the layout's rail provides the single `<nav aria-label="…">` landmark (Task 4), mirroring how the FoH rail wraps `NavLinks` in a `<nav>`.
- [ ] **Task 4 — Upgrade `backroom/layout.tsx` to the two-pane shell + mount the mobile drawer (AC: #1, #3, #4)**
  - [ ] Replace the current `<main className="p-2 min-h-screen"><div className="max-w-screen-md …"><BackLink/>…</div></main>` body with the two-pane shell. Recommended structure (Server Component; tune classes to match the mock — see Dev Notes "Two-pane layout — exact spec"):
    - **`lg+`:** root `lg:h-screen lg:overflow-hidden lg:p-12` (48px frame) → shell `lg:grid lg:grid-cols-[320px_1fr] lg:h-[calc(100vh-96px)] rounded-md overflow-hidden lg:shadow-[0_10px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]` → left `<nav aria-label="Backroom documentation" className="hidden lg:flex lg:flex-col gap-1.5 bg-primary-200 overflow-y-auto py-[18px]">` holding `<BackLink/>` then `<BackroomNav/>`; right `<main className="bg-primary-400 lg:px-14 lg:py-12 overflow-y-auto">{children}</main>`.
    - **`< lg`:** single full-width column — the `<nav>` rail is `hidden lg:flex` (so it disappears); the `<main>` runs full-width with sensible padding (e.g. `p-4`/`pt-8`); the drawer (next subtask) is the only nav surface.
  - [ ] Mount the **mobile drawer** with the same nav content, passed as **server-rendered children** so `doc.content` never enters the client bundle: `<BackroomMobileMenu><BackLink/><BackroomNav/></BackroomMobileMenu>` (the drawer's internals are `lg:hidden`). See Dev Notes "Mobile drawer reuse" for the recommended dedicated-drawer approach.
  - [ ] **Do NOT** import `ContentTransition`/`FrozenRouter`/`CustomScroll` (AR-8/G4 — least resistance = no transition; the panes scroll via native `overflow-y-auto`). Front↔back navigation stays a plain navigation.
  - [ ] Keep `BackLink` (already exists, `src/components/atoms/back-link.tsx`) — reuse as-is, at the top of the rail and at the top of the drawer (matches the mock).
- [ ] **Task 5 — The Backroom mobile drawer (AC: #3)**
  - [ ] **Recommended (Option A — zero FoH touch):** create `src/components/molecules/backroom-mobile-menu.tsx` — `'use client'`; a dedicated vaul drawer mirroring `mobile-menu.tsx` (same `Drawer.Root direction="right"` driven by `useMenuOpen()`, same burger `Drawer.Trigger` + `Drawer.Close` + `Drawer.Title sr-only`), **reusing the existing `mobile-menu.module.css`** for `burgerButton`/`overlay`/`panel`/`closeButton`/`itemList`. It renders `{children}` (the back link + nav passed from the server layout) inside `Drawer.Content`. Do **not** import `NavLinks` here. (See Dev Notes for why a dedicated drawer beats parametrising the shared `MobileMenu`.)
  - [ ] Confirm the drawer's fixed burger (top-right, `z-index:1000`) does **not** collide with the theme toggle (top-left) and that opening it shows the back link + the full sectioned nav; selecting a row navigates **and** closes the drawer (via the row's `setMenuOpen(false)`); Esc and the close button work (vaul default).
- [ ] **Task 6 — Backroom 404 centring in the new pane (folds in the deferred item) (AC: #1)**
  - [ ] The two-pane content pane now gives `backroom/not-found.tsx` (which renders `NotFoundContent`) a height ancestor. Verify `NotFoundContent` (`h-full … justify-center`) centres in the content pane; if it still collapses to the top, give the pane / its inner wrapper the `h-full` chain it needs (small, contained fix). This closes the carried `deferred-work.md` item _"NotFoundContent vertical centering breaks inside BackroomLayout … backroom-404 styling is a later (2.4) story."_ The **duplicated-404-metadata** deferred item stays deferred (out of scope unless trivially resolved while here).
- [ ] **Task 7 — Build/lint/static-export + zero-regression gates (AC: #4)**
  - [ ] `npm run build` → green, **pure static export**: `/backroom` (`○ (Static)`) and the three `/backroom/<slug>` routes (`○ (Static)` or `● (SSG)` — 2.3 emitted the slug routes as `● (SSG)`; both are prerendered, the gate is **no `.func` in `out/`**). FoH routes still static. (Velite runs first via `next.config.mjs`; if `@velite` ever looks unresolved, that is the known fresh-checkout ordering quirk — a build regenerates `.velite/`.)
  - [ ] `npm run lint` → clean (watch for unused imports; `usePathname` only in the new client row).
  - [ ] **FoH zero-regression (NFR-2):** under Option A this story edits **no** `(site)`/`SiteShell`/`MobileMenu`/`NavLinks` file, so FoH is unchanged by construction — confirm the FoH routes build identically and (Zac, on `npm run dev`/preview) the sidebar/hero/nav/route-transition/mobile drawer behave exactly as before.
  - [ ] **Manual (Zac, on `npm run dev`/preview — not headlessly verifiable):** two-pane layout at `lg+` with independent nav/content scroll; **theme toggle** flips both panes and the nav (cyan↔blue, gold↔terracotta, `bg-primary-*`) with code/prose legible; the **selected row** (Overview by default on `/backroom`; the doc's row on `/backroom/<slug>`) shows cyan tint + accent bar + inverted tile and `aria-current="page"`; **below `lg`** the rail is gone, the hamburger opens the full nav, a row navigates + closes the drawer, content is full-width; keyboard tab order + visible focus on rows; the **G4 transition review** (expected: none → ship as-is).

## Dev Notes

### What this story is (and is not)

This is the **visible Backroom** — it turns the minimal isolated room from Story 2.2 (a centred column with a back-link) into the **two-pane reading room** from the mock: a 320px sectioned nav rail beside the `doc-content` pane (Story 2.3), with the whole nav collapsing into the vaul drawer below `lg`. It builds the nav component tree (`backroom-nav` organism → `backroom-nav-row` molecule → `number-tile`/`glyph-tile`/`section-label` atoms) driven entirely by the Velite typed `docs` array, plus a Backroom mobile drawer. It is **not**: the new Decisions content (Story **2.5** adds ~10 MADR docs that this nav will render automatically), the Shiki-fallback patch (Story 2.5), the front-of-house **Entry link** (Story **2.6**), or the **console egg** (Story **2.7**). No pipeline/Velite/`globals.css`-token changes, no new dependencies. Discipline: **calm and content-first over flash** (SM-C1/SM-C2), stay thin.

### Current state — what you're building on (READ before editing)

`src/app/backroom/layout.tsx` **today** (the thing Task 4 replaces):

```tsx
import BackLink from '@/components/atoms/back-link';

export default function BackroomLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode }>) {
  return (
    <main className="p-2 min-h-screen">
      <div className="max-w-screen-md mx-auto pt-8">
        <BackLink />
        <div className="pt-8">{children}</div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

- `src/app/backroom/page.tsx` (Overview) selects `docs.find(d => d.section === 'Overview')` → renders `<DocContent doc={doc} />`. `src/app/backroom/[slug]/page.tsx` has `dynamicParams = false` + `generateStaticParams()` over every non-Overview doc. **Both already work and are unchanged by this story** — you only change the _layout_ that wraps them.
- `src/components/atoms/back-link.tsx` exists: `<Link href="/" className="text-dim hover:text-secondary">◀ back to the site</Link>`. Reuse as-is.
- `src/components/organisms/doc-content.tsx` already renders the doc header (eyebrow + Permanent-Marker title + ADR meta) and injects `doc.content` HTML; `doc-content.module.css` **already caps the prose to 64ch**. The layout's content pane only supplies the `bg-primary-400` surface + 56px padding + independent scroll — **don't re-cap to 64ch**.
- `MenuProvider` is mounted **globally** in the root layout (wraps all children incl. `/backroom`), so `useMenuOpen()` is available inside the Backroom tree. `mobile-menu.module.css` (`burgerButton`/`overlay`/`panel`/`closeButton`/`itemList`) is reusable. [Source: codebase map; src/app/backroom/*; src/components/atoms/back-link.tsx; src/components/organisms/doc-content.*; src/context/menu-open-context.tsx]

### The FoH two-pane pattern to mirror (`SiteShell`)

`src/components/organisms/site-shell.tsx` is the existing two-pane reference — mirror its _approach_, not its exact classes:

- **Left rail:** `lg:w-72 lg:bg-primary-200`, with a `<nav className="… hidden lg:flex">` holding `<NavLinks />`. The rail is `hidden`/collapsed below `lg`.
- **Right content pane:** `bg-primary-400 rounded … overflow-hidden`, wraps children.
- **Mobile:** `<MobileMenu />` (vaul drawer) sits _outside_ `<main>`; it is the only nav below `lg`.
- **Mobile vs desktop is pure CSS** (`hidden lg:flex` rail vs `lg:hidden` drawer). **There is no `useMediaQuery`/JS breakpoint hook** in the project (the only `matchMedia` is MobileMenu's auto-close). Build the Backroom responsive split the same way — Tailwind `lg:` utilities, **not** JS. [Source: codebase map; src/components/organisms/site-shell.tsx]

### Two-pane layout — exact spec (from the mock + DESIGN tokens)

`backroom-mock.html` is the composition reference (DESIGN/EXPERIENCE spines win on conflict). Translate its CSS into Tailwind utilities + the site's `@utility` tokens:

| Mock CSS                                                                                                                                                          | Backroom Tailwind                                                                                                              |

| `.content { background:var(--bg-primary-400); padding:48px 56px; overflow-y:auto }`                                                                               | `bg-primary-400 lg:py-12 lg:px-14 overflow-y-auto`                                                                             |

- **Frame sizing (48px)** is so the page chrome — top-left theme toggle now, bottom-left Entry link in Story 2.6 — has breathing room and never crowds the shell. 48px = `p-12`; 56px pane padding = `px-14`; 320px rail = `grid-cols-[320px_1fr]` (320px is not a default width token). All `lg:`-gated.
- **`lg:h-screen lg:overflow-hidden`** on the layout root so only the panes scroll at `lg+`; below `lg` it's normal document flow (`min-h-screen`).
- **Depth:** the single `lg:shadow-[…]` is the one permitted soft drop-shadow; otherwise flat/tonal (UX-DR2, "Elevation & Depth"). No borders between panes — the `bg-primary-200`↔`bg-primary-400` one-step tonal difference does the separating. [Source: backroom-mock.html; DESIGN.md Layout/Elevation; UX-DR2]

**Theme-token discipline:** use the `@utility` tokens (`text-secondary`, `bg-secondary`, `text-tertiary`, `bg-tertiary`, `bg-primary-400`, `text-primary`, `text-dim`) for all **solid** colours so they flip with `.light`. The four low-alpha rgba values (hover wash, selected wash, the two tile borders) are **DESIGN-specified literals** with no token equivalent — express them as static Tailwind arbitrary-value classes. They are **constant across themes** (the selected wash stays cyan-tinted even in light, where the accent token is blue) — this is the same call Story 2.3 made for the gold blockquote call-out and is consistent with DESIGN. Flag for Zac's light-theme eyeball (Flagged decision 3). `globals.css` is **not** edited in this story — all tokens already exist (`bg-primary-200/400`, `text-secondary/tertiary/primary/dim`, all confirmed present, both themes). [Source: backroom-mock.html; DESIGN.md components; UX-DR4/5/6/7/16; codebase map globals.css]

> Styling choice (minor, your call): the nav is **real JSX** (not injected HTML), so Tailwind utilities work directly — unlike `doc-content` which needed a CSS module for injected HTML. The arbitrary-value rgba classes are slightly ugly inline; a small `backroom-nav-row.module.css` (per the Story-2.3 precedent for DESIGN rgba) is equally acceptable. Default to Tailwind utilities to match the FoH nav's utilities-in-JSX style.

### The active-state pattern to mirror (`nav-link.tsx`) — and the `aria-current` upgrade

The FoH `src/components/atoms/nav-link.tsx` is the precedent: `'use client'` + `usePathname()`, active styling applied as a className string. **Two deltas for the Backroom row:**

1. The FoH nav has **no `aria-current`** today (active is visual-only). The Backroom row **adds `aria-current="page"`** (NFR-5/UX-DR18 require it) — net-new, set on the `<Link>` when `isCurrent`.
2. FoH uses `startsWith` for sub-routes; Backroom doc routes are **leaves**, so use **exact** `pathname === href` (otherwise `/backroom` would match every `/backroom/*`). Overview's href is `/backroom`; doc rows are `/backroom/<slug>`. [Source: codebase map; src/components/atoms/nav-link.tsx; UX-DR4/18]

### Mobile drawer reuse — recommended approach (Flagged decision 1)

The nav must appear in the vaul drawer below `lg`. The current `MobileMenu` (`src/components/molecules/mobile-menu.tsx`) **hardcodes `<NavLinks />`** (the FoH nav) and is a frozen FoH client island. Two ways to give the Backroom its drawer nav:

- **(A — RECOMMENDED) A dedicated `backroom-mobile-menu.tsx`.** A second vaul drawer that reuses `useMenuOpen()` + `mobile-menu.module.css`, rendering the Backroom nav (passed as children). **Zero FoH files touched** → the NFR-2/G1 zero-regression gate holds _by construction_. The two drawers are **never mounted at once** (different rooms / route trees), so sharing `useMenuOpen` state is harmless. Cost: ~25 lines of vaul structural JSX duplicated (styles stay DRY via the shared module). This is the pragmatic, low-blast-radius call.
- **(B) Parametrise the shared `MobileMenu`** to accept `children`. DRY in theory, but it cascades into touching **three** frozen FoH files: `MobileMenu` (signature), `SiteShell` (call site), and `NavLinks` (the close-on-select handler currently comes from `MobileMenu`'s scope via the `onClick` prop — passing content from a _Server Component_ parent means the rows must close via `useMenuOpen()` themselves instead). That is real regression surface on the highest-priority gate for little gain (only ever two rooms).

**Default to (A)** and surface the choice for Zac (per memory _don't-assert-secondhand-decisions-as-closed_). Either way: the drawer renders **server-rendered children** (`<BackLink/>` + `<BackroomNav/>`), and rows close the drawer via `useMenuOpen().setMenuOpen(false)`. [Source: codebase map; src/components/molecules/mobile-menu.tsx; architecture.md#D4 ("each room supplies its own MobileMenu contents into the shared vaul drawer"); CLAUDE.md "minimum necessary complexity"; memory]

### RSC payload gotcha — don't ship `doc.content` to the client

`doc.content` is the **full rendered HTML string** of each doc (Shiki baked in). If `backroom-nav` (which imports the `docs` array) ends up **inside the client bundle** — e.g. by being imported _into_ a client component like the drawer — the entire `docs` array, including every `content` string, ships to the browser. That bloats the bundle and breaks the "zero client JS for docs" intent (NFR-4).

**Avoid it with the children pattern:** keep `backroom-nav` a **Server Component**, and pass it as **`children`/props** into the client drawer (`<BackroomMobileMenu><BackroomNav/></BackroomMobileMenu>`). A client component that _accepts_ a server component as children does **not** pull it into the client bundle — the server renders it and streams the result. The only client leaf is `backroom-nav-row` (needs `usePathname`), and it receives just `{ href, title, teaser, section, adr }` — **never `content`**. Don't `import BackroomNav` _inside_ `BackroomMobileMenu`; receive it as `{children}`. [Source: React Server Components composition rules; codebase map; architecture.md#Component-boundary; NFR-4]

### Selected glyph-tile fill (Flagged decision 2)

UX-DR4 says a selected row's tile "inverts to a solid **cyan** fill"; UX-DR5 (number-tile) confirms cyan; UX-DR6 says the glyph-tile is "as number-tile but **gold**." It's ambiguous whether a _selected gold glyph_ tile inverts to **cyan** (literal "selected = cyan") or **gold** (preserving the section's colour identity). This matters immediately: **the Overview ★ row is `selected` by default on `/backroom`**.

- **Recommended:** selected `number-tile` → **cyan** fill; selected `glyph-tile` → **gold** fill (`bg-tertiary` + `bg-primary-400` text). DESIGN.md is emphatic that "cyan = decision/link, gold = judgement — keep that meaning consistent" (a **Do**); inverting the gold tile to cyan on selection breaks that. The cyan **row accent bar + wash** already signal selection regardless of tile colour.
- **Alt (literal spec):** all selected tiles → cyan fill.

Implement the recommended (per-section colour) version and **flag it for Zac** to confirm on visual QA. [Source: UX-DR4/5/6; DESIGN.md Do/Don'ts; EXPERIENCE.md State Patterns "Default entry → Overview … nav row selected"]

### Route transitions / scroll (AR-8 / G4)

Path of least resistance = **omit** `ContentTransition`/`FrozenRouter`/`CustomScroll` (all FoH-only client islands, wired into `SiteShell`). The current minimal Backroom layout already omits them, so the natural two-pane layout has **no inter-doc transition** — which is the recommended G4 outcome ("if none, ship as-is"). The independent nav/content scroll is plain `overflow-y-auto` on each pane (no `CustomScroll`). **Don't** add a transition; surface the G4 review for Zac after the build (expected: confirm none).

| `src/components/molecules/backroom-nav-row.module.css` | **NEW (optional)** | only if you prefer a module over arbitrary-value classes         |

Reused unchanged: `back-link.tsx`, `doc-content.*`, `not-found-content.tsx` (verify centring, Task 6), `mobile-menu.module.css` (shared styles), `menu-open-context.tsx`. **No edits** to any `(site)`/`SiteShell`/`MobileMenu`/`NavLinks`/`globals.css`/`velite.config.ts`/`package.json` under the recommended approach. `'use client'` is confined to `backroom-nav-row` + `backroom-mobile-menu`; everything else (layout, `backroom-nav`, tiles, label) stays a Server Component.

### Verification standard (no test suite)

`npm test` is a stub (`exit 1`) — **no** test framework; do not fabricate test runs (AR-15). Verification is:

1. **Build:** `npm run build` green; `/backroom` + the three `/backroom/<slug>` routes prerendered (no `.func`); FoH routes unchanged. (Cold `rm -rf .velite && npm run build` if you touched anything build-adjacent — you shouldn't have.)
2. **Lint:** `npm run lint` clean.
3. **FoH zero-regression (NFR-2):** no `(site)`/SiteShell files edited → confirm FoH output is unchanged.
4. **Manual (Zac, `npm run dev`/preview — not headlessly verifiable):** two-pane layout + independent scroll at `lg+`; theme toggle flips both panes/nav; selected row (cyan tint + accent bar + inverted tile + `aria-current`); `< lg` rail-gone + hamburger nav + close-on-select + full-width content; keyboard tab order + visible focus; G4 transition review (expected none).

### Previous-story intelligence (2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3)

- **2.3 (done)** stood up the pipeline + `/backroom` (Overview) + `/backroom/[slug]` routes + `doc-content` (which **already caps 64ch** and owns the eyebrow/title/meta) + the `back-link` atom + `text-dim`/`code-surface`/`--shiki-*` tokens. **This story consumes that as-is** — no pipeline/token change. The four current docs: `start-here` (Overview), `framework-decision` (Decisions, adr 4), `deferring-the-polish` + `building-with-ai-and-bmad` (Pragmatism & process) → all three sections are populated, so you can see grouping/sort/omit working today; the Decisions group fills out in **2.5**. A flagged 2.3 follow-up (none of the docs ship a code block) is **2.5's** concern, not this story's.
- **2.2 (done)** created the plain `src/app/backroom/` folder (not a route group), the minimal layout this story upgrades, and `backroom/not-found.tsx` (renders inside the Backroom shell — Task 6 verifies its centring in the new pane). `MenuProvider` stays global.
- **Discipline carry-over.** Every prior story held a hard "stay thin, scope the diff, don't gold-plate" line and **surfaced flagged decisions for Zac** rather than baking them. Same here — surface the three flagged decisions (drawer approach, glyph-tile selected fill, constant rgba washes) and the G4 transition review.

### Git intelligence

Commits follow `feat: Project Ariadne story 2-N created` → `… code complete`, one focused diff per story (`a4f7833` = Story 2.3 code complete, the baseline here). Keep this diff scoped to the new Backroom nav/tile components + the layout upgrade + the dedicated drawer. **No** drive-by edits to FoH components, `globals.css`, the Velite config, or `package.json`.

### Project Structure Notes

- New components land in their declared tiers (atoms: tiles/label; molecule: nav-row + mobile-menu; organism: backroom-nav) per the architecture tree (lines 413–428). [Source: architecture.md#Project-Structure]
- Tailwind-v4 discipline: utilities in JSX (no `tailwind.config.js`); the `xs:410px` + default `lg:1024px` breakpoints exist; theme tokens are `@utility` blocks; **don't** add tokens or `@layer base` CSS here (none needed). [Source: project-context.md#Tailwind; codebase map globals.css]
- Static-export law: no server APIs; the nav is a pure build-time function of `docs`; every route prerenders. [Source: project-context.md#Static-export; architecture.md#Build-time-vs-runtime]
