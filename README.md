# Zac Braddy's CV website

This was built originally off the gatsby starter project and a lot of the original tasks from that remain so if you're pulling down this repo and you've used gatsby then you should feel pretty comfortable.

The gatsby starter was simply used for scaffolding however, the site was then built from scratch using various technologies.
